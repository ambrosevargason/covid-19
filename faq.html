                                           <h2> What is the novel coronavirus COVID-19? </h2>

                                            <p> A coronavirus is a virus that is common among people and animals. </p>

                                            <p> The coronavirus you are hearing about — COVID-19 — is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. It was first discovered in China in late 2019. </p>

                                            <h2> How serious is COVID-19? </h2>

                                            <p> The severity of the illness varies from person to person.</p>
                                            <p>For many people, the virus will not lead to any serious complications or hospitalization, but some cases can lead to pneumonia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires a patient to be put on a ventilator with oxygen. If the lungs are damaged and insufficient oxygen reaches the rest of the body, respiratory failure can lead to organ failure and death.</p>
                                            <p>People with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease, liver disease, diabetes, or respiratory illness) and those older than 60 are most at risk of serious infection.</p>

                                            <h2 id="symptoms">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>

                                            <p>The flu, the common cold, seasonal allergies and COVID-19 may have similar symptoms, so it is important to know what to look for when evaluating how you are feeling. People with COVID-19 may or may not experience all of the common symptoms.</p>

                                            <p>Current symptoms reported with COVID-19 include: loss of smell, diarrhea, fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.</p>

                                            <p>Aches and pains are more commonly associated with the flu but have been reported with COVID-19.</p>

                                            <p>Nearly half of people with COVID-19 report having digestive problems.</p>

                                            <p>If you are sneezing or have a runny nose, it is more likely that you have allergies or a cold, but watch for other symptoms. Maintain good respiratory hygiene: cough or sneeze into a tissue, dispose of it and wash your hands, or cough/sneeze into your upper arm or elbow.</p>

                                            <h2 id="whattodo">What should I do if I am sick?</h2>

                                            <p>Do not go to work, school or any other public places.</p>

                                            <p>As with many other viruses, you need to rest, drink fluids and control fever to help relieve symptoms.</p>

                                            <p>If you have symptoms associated with COVID-19 (loss of smell, diarrhea, fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath), self-quarantine and contact your health care provider or call the Metro Public Health Department COVID-19 Hotline at 615-862-7777 (7 a.m. – 7 p.m., daily).</p>

                                            <p>If you are sick but do not have symptoms associated with COVID-19 (loss of smell, diarrhea, fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath), stay home and rest – unless you need to get medical care. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, self-quarantine and contact your health care provider or Metro’s COVID-19 Hotline.</p>

                                            <p>Separate yourself from other people in your home. Avoid sharing household items with others in your home.</p>

                                            <p>If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, a severe headache or other potentially life-threatening problems, go to the nearest emergency department or call 911.</p>

                                            <h2 id="prevention">How is COVID-19 spread?</h2>

                                            <p>The virus is spread mainly from person-to-person contact – like shaking hands – and through respiratory droplets produced when someone with the virus sneezes or coughs.</p>
                                            <p>The virus can remain on objects or surfaces touched by someone with COVID-19. If you touch a contaminated object or surface and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus can spread to you.</p>
                                            <p>Most early cases of COVID-19 in the United States were associated with travel in countries where the virus was more prevalent. Increasingly, however, the virus is “community-acquired” — caught through close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

                                            <h2>How do I keep from catching COVID-19?</h2>
                                            <p>Limit close interactions with other people – also known as “social distancing.” Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others.</p>
                                            <p>Try not to touch people or surfaces where the virus could be.</p>
                                            <p>Wash your hands – including fingernails and wrists – frequently with soap, for at least 20 seconds. Dry with a paper towel to remove residual germs and use it to turn the faucet handle so you don’t recontaminate your hands. Throw the paper towel away.</p>
                                            <p>If soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) to scrub your hands like you would with soap and water.</p>
                                            <p>Remember to disinfect commonly used surfaces and items frequently, using regular household cleaners or wipes.</p>
                                            <p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, and throw it away. Wash your hands immediately.</p>
                                            <p>Though people are thought to be most contagious when they are showing symptoms, the virus can be spread even when an infected person shows no symptoms.</p>

                                            <h2 id="testing">How do I get a COVID-19 test?</h2>
                                            <p>Testing is available to all Nashville residents at no cost.</p>
                                            <p>Call the Metro Public Health COVID-19 Information Hotline – 615-862-7777, 7 a.m-7 p.m. daily – to speak with a public health professional about your symptoms.</p>
                                            <p>If needed, you will be directed to a Metro Community Assessment Center for testing.</p>
                                            <p>Centers are open M, W and F from 9 a.m. – 3 p.m. and provide both drive-thru or walk up service.</p>
